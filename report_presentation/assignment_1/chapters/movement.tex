\section{Movement}
The movement of the robot is managed through the \texttt{move\_base} action system of the robot. Each single topic (goal, feedback, and result) is read separately for convenience.\\
The server receives the orientation of the robot as an angle in radians with respect to the original orientation of the robot, but it should send it as a Quaternion. To achieve this, it uses an object of type \texttt{tf2::Quaternion} and the function \texttt{Quaternion::setRPY()}.\\\\
The position and the quaternion are sent to the robot on the \texttt{/move\_base/goal} topic. The robot then automatically starts moving towards the given position and orientates itself with the provided angle once it reaches it.\\\\
While the robot moves, it sends its current position on the topic \texttt{/move\_base/feedback} (along with other information), and when it reaches the goal, it sends a message on the topic \texttt{/move\_base/result}.\\

\section{Code Structure}
The structure of our code is based on a simple action client-server architecture where the client sends the goal to the server and the server does all the tasks. 
The main components that we developed are:
\begin{itemize}
    \item the Action Message (MoveDetectAction)
    \item the Action Client (TiagoClient)
    \item the Action Server (TiagoServer)
\end{itemize}
